            <h2 id="server-requirements">Server Requirements</h2>
            <p>To run Task Closer your hosting server must support the following:</p>
            <blockquote>
                PHP version 5.4 or greater;<br>
                MySQL version 5.x or greater;<br>
                PHP PDO MYSQL extension;<br>
                PHP IMAP extension (for tickets autoimport);<br>
                PHP FSOCKOPEN extenstion (for service monitoring);<br>
                Cronjob (for automated tasks like email ticket and service monitoring).
            </blockquote>
            <p>Task Closer will run on almost all hosts, if monitoring doesn’t work contact your hosting provider for enabling php_fsockopen.</p>
            <p>We strongly suggest that you enable SSL on your web server if you are going tu use the credentials manager feature.</p>

            <h2 id="translating">Translating</h2>
            <p>Task Closer uses an implementation of gettext to provide multilanguage support.</p>
            <p>Gettext uses ".po" and ".mo" files to hold the translations.<br>
                ".po" (Portable Object) is a text file that includes the original texts and the translations, this file can be used for editing.<br>
                ".mo" (Machine Object) files are compiled and are easy for computers to read, this file is used by Task Closer to provide translations.
            </p>

            <p>Follow these steps to translate Task Closer</p>
            <ol>
                <li>"template.po" file is provided in the "lang" folder</li>
                <li>Edit this file with a PO file editor</li>
                <li>Compile .mo file with your PO file editor, save your file in the following format languagecode.mo (example: en.po, fr.po, it.po etc.)</li>
                <li>Copy the .mo file in the "lang/overrides" folder of your Task Closer installation.</li>
                <li>Go to System > Settings > Localisation and add your new language, use the 2 letters language code for the code field.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>To edit .po files you can use <a href="http://poedit.net/">Poedit</a>, a simple to use and free application.</p>

            <p><b>Notice:</b> As new features are added to Task Closer, new text strings might need translating, whith each new update, if new strings available, will be added to the template file. You can import them with Poedit in your language file.</p>
            <p><b>Notice:</b> Place all translation files in the "lang/overrides" folder. Placing them directly into the "lang" folder might get overwritten.</p>
            <p><b>Notice:</b> Language code must be the same as the filename (example: if you have the file fr.mo the code is fr).</p>
            <p><b>Notice:</b> If the system does not find the required string in your translation file it will use the default English for that string.</p>
            <p><b>Notice:</b> Users/Admins can set different languages, if preffered, which overrides the default language set in Settings > Localisation.</p>
